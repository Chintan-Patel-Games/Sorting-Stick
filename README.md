# Sorting Stick

**Sorting Stick** is a visual representation of popular sorting algorithms built using **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)** in C++. This educational game helps users understand how different sorting algorithms operate by animating their processes.

## 🖥️ 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++**
- **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**

## 📚 Algorithms Demonstrated

- **Bubble Sort** – Repeatedly swaps adjacent sticks if they are in the wrong order, bubbling the largest to the end.
- **Insertion Sort** – Builds the sorted array one stick at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
- **Selection Sort** – Finds the smallest stick in each pass and places it at the correct position from the start.
- **Merge Sort** – Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort** – Partitions the array around a pivot and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
- **Radix Sort** – Sorts sticks by processing digits from least to most significant using counting sort as a subroutine.

## 💡 Data Structure Used

- The sticks are stored in a **dynamic array**
- Each Stick is a custom struct that contains properties such as height and color, used for visualization.

## 🎮 Features

- Real-time visual feedback for sorting operations
- Highlights each step during the sort
- Educational tool for beginners to understand sorting algorithms visually
